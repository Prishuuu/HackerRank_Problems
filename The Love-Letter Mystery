James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend.
James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.
Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. 
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

int theLoveLetterMystery(string s) {
    int ans=0, start=0, end=s.size()-1;
    while(start<end)
    {
        ans=ans+abs(s[start]-s[end]);
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    return ans;
}
