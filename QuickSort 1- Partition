The previous challenges covered Insertion Sort, which is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm with a running time of O(n^2). 
In these next few challenges, we're covering a divide-and-conquer algorithm called Quicksort (also known as Partition Sort). 
This challenge is a modified version of the algorithm that only addresses partitioning.

vector<int> quickSort(vector<int> arr) 
{
    int pivot = arr[0];
    vector<int> left, right;
    
    for (int i = 1; i<arr.size(); i++) 
    {
        if (arr[i]<pivot) 
        {
            left.push_back(arr[i]);
        }
        else 
        {
            right.push_back(arr[i]);
        }
    }
    left.push_back(pivot);
    left.insert(left.end(), right.begin(), right.end());
    
    return left;
}
