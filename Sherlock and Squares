Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. 
He will provide a starting and ending value that describe a range of integers, inclusive of the endpoints. 
Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

int squares(int a, int b) {
    int start = sqrt(a);
    if (start * start < a) start++;
    int end = sqrt(b);
    return max(0, end - start + 1);
}
