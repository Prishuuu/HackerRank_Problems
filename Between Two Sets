There will be two arrays of integers. 
Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. 
Determine how many such numbers exist.

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

int getTotalX(vector<int> a, vector<int> b) {
    int lcm_a = a[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < a.size(); i++) {
        lcm_a = lcm(lcm_a, a[i]);
    }
    int gcd_b = b[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < b.size(); i++) {
        gcd_b = gcd(gcd_b, b[i]);
    } 
    int count = 0;
    for (int x = lcm_a; x <= gcd_b; x += lcm_a) {
        if (gcd_b % x == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
