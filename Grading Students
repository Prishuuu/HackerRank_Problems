Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

vector<int> gradingStudents(vector<int> grades) {
    vector<int> res;
    for(int i=0;i<grades.size();i++)
    {
        if(grades[i]>=38)
        {
            int s= (grades[i]/5)+1;
            if(s*5-grades[i]<3)
            {
                grades[i]=s*5;
            }
        }
    }
    return grades;
}
