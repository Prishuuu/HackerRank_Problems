Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. 
She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. 
Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

vector<int> breakingRecords(vector<int> scores) {
    int max_breaks = 0;
    int min_breaks = 0;
    int max_score = scores[0];
    int min_score = scores[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < scores.size(); i++) {
        if (scores[i] > max_score) 
        {
            max_score = scores[i];
            max_breaks++;  
        } 
        else if (scores[i] < min_score) {
            min_score = scores[i];
            min_breaks++;  
        }
    }
    return {max_breaks, min_breaks};
}
