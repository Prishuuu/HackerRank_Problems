Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. 
A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.
Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:
It must be greater than the original word
It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition

string biggerIsGreater(string w) {
    int i = w.size() - 2;
    while (i >= 0 && w[i] >= w[i + 1]) i--;
    if (i == -1) return "no answer";
    int j = w.size() - 1;
    while (w[j] <= w[i]) j--;
    swap(w[i], w[j]);
    reverse(w.begin() + i + 1, w.end());
    return w;
}
