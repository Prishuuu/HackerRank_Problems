Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. 
Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. 
You must determine if his calculation is correct.

void bonAppetit(vector<int> bill, int k, int b) {
    int actual;
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<bill.size();i++)
    {
        sum=sum+bill[i];
    }
    sum=sum-bill[k];
    int half=sum/2;
    
    if(half==b)
    {
        cout<<"Bon Appetit";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<(b-half);
    }
}
